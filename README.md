# My `seq` util implementation

So, I was reading about unix and then I discovered a util called "seq": 
searched a little bit, learned how it works and I then decided to try to
make a implemention.
It ain't perfect, if you don't pass the values it will segfault, but it is
functional (as far as I know).
